SERVER CODE LOGIC
Here I am Writing A server Code that listens on all interfaces and binds them to a port and a socket
This socket is ised for listening on all interfaces for connection requests. When we do recieve a connection it is accepted by another socket new_socket which reads the message and sends the same message back to the client.
Only One client is handled in this code.
